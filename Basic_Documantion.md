The project consists the class of "Graph" that allows loading graphs from a file (in the format), and represents the data structure of a particular graph. The class enable supporting the updating of the data structure and basic methods about its parameters, For example, the amount of vertices, edges, etc. In addition, consists class of "Graph_algo" contains the following functions: a. Calculating the distance between two vertices (the length of the shortest path in the graph). b. Route calculation of the shortest path between two vertices in the graph. c. Calculating the shortest path between two vertices in the graph without going "black list". At the end unit test classes are testing correctness\efficiency of the code we wrote.
